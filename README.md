# Powering-ChiselStore-with-Omni-Paxos
The project aims at replacing Raft with Omnipaxos in an Open source system called Chiselstore. Omni-Paxos is a replicated log library of sequence consensus similar to Raft. Chiselstore is a distributed SQLite which is powered by Raft consensus algorithm implemented in Rust language.
